# Introduction

Forms are managed by [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) and the form inputs are registered via the 
[register api](https://react-hook-form.com/api/useform/register) (e.g. `TextBoxInput`) or the [Controller api](https://react-hook-form.com/api/usecontroller/controller) 
(e.g. `SelectInput` via `FormInputWrapper`). Inputs are first validated onblur or when the form is submitted. They
differentiate between disabled, error, and validated states as well as hover/focused/active pseudo classes. Validation
is also done at an input level, showing error messages close to the input. 

## Getting Started

Inputs should have these properties to be able to display all the various states in the design system


| Required Input Prop | Reason |
| :--  | :-- |
| name | The input's `id` property to link label and input together |
| onChange/onBlur | Expose the value after events so parent can change state accordingly |
| value | The value to display in the input |
| placeholder | Input hint (if needed/has a place) |
| inputRef | If validation fails, calls `focus()` on this element if it is the earliest error |
| isDisabled / isError / isValidated | The states of an input (along with default, as well as hover/active/focus). The input should have styling to match each of the above states |
| showIcon | The icon to match the design system. This should also be styled to match isDisabled / isError / isValidated |

```js highlight-line="2"
import classNames from "classnames/bind";
import FontAwesome from "react-fontawesome";
import styles from "SomeInput.module.scss";

const cx = classNames.bind(styles);

const SomeInput = (props) => (
  <div>
    <input
      id={props.name}
      className={cx("someInput", {
        "someInput--validated": props.isValidated,
        "someInput--error": props.isError,
        "someInput--disabled": props.isDisabled,
      })}
      onChange={props.onChange}
      onBlur={props.onBlur}
      value={props.value}
      placeholder={props.placeholder}
      ref={props.inputRef}
    />

    {props.showIcon && props.isValidated && (
      <FontAwesome
        name={
          props.isDisabled ? "disabled-icon" : props.isError ? "error-icon" : "valid-icon"
        }
        className={cx("icon", {
          "icon--validated": props.isValidated,
          "icon--error": props.isError,
          "icon--disabled": props.isDisabled,
        })}
      />
    )}
  </div>
);
```
A contrived example, but it should be enough to show to be able to display all the necessary states for the
design system. `someInput:hover`, `someInput:focused`, and `someInput:active` should be addressed as well
in the scss file.

## Connecting the input via `FormInputWrapper`

The basic design of the forms in the design guideline has a form label and an isRequired label at the top
and the error message at the bottom. Using the `FormLabel` and `FormError` components can be done, but
using the `FormInputWrapper` should be simpler, as long as the following props is added:

| Required Input Prop | Reason |
| :--  | :-- |
| as | The form input component (that uses the above props) being rendered |
| Label | The text associated with the input |
| isRequired | Enhances validation, adds isRequired label to the right |
| validate | custom validation object if needed |

```js highlight-line="2"
const ControlledSomeInput = (props) => {
  return <FormInputWrapper as={SomeInput} {...props}  />;
};
```

## Using `useForm()` to manage the form

The useForm in `utils` folder has some defaults to use (e.g. validate onTouch/submit). It can be
extended just like the [useForm api](https://react-hook-form.com/api/useform) and the formMethods
can be destructured to get any of the methods needed to manage the form e.g. `defaultValues` object
can be passed to set initial values or to have them reset to those values.

```js highlight-line="2"
import useForm from "../utils/hooks/useForm";
import FormInputWrapper from "./FormInputWrapper";

const SomeForm = () => {
  const formMethods = useForm();
  const [isDisabled, setIsDisabled] = useState(false);

  const handleSubmit = async (formState) => {
    setIsDisabled(true);
    try {
      await SomeService(formState);
    } finally {
      setIsDisabled(false);
    }
  }

  return (
    <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit} {...formMethods}>
      <FormInputWrapper name="uniqueName" as={SomeInput} isDisabled={isDisabled} />
    </Form>
  );
};
```
