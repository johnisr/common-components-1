# Introduction

Storybook is a UI development environment and playground for UI
components. The tool enables users to create components independently
and showcase components interactively in an isolated development
environment.

Storybook runs outside of the main app so users can develop UI
components in isolation without worrying about app specific
dependencies or requirements.

## Getting Started

To run the storybook app run: `npm run storybook`. The storybook application will start on `http://localhost:9001`

## Adding stories

Stories should be put in the same folder as the component it is referencing, with the same name but with the
suffix `.stories.js` or `.stories.mdx`.
